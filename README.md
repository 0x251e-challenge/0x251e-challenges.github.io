# Self-Crafted CTF Challenges

This repository contains my journey of creating unique CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. These challenges are inspired by techniques and vulnerabilities from past CTF events, utilizing various methods of exploitation that can be translated into different CTF categories.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Develop and design CTF challenges that cover a wide range of cybersecurity skills and knowledge.
- Learn from past CTF events and implement new techniques to create engaging and educational challenges.
- Provide resources and experiences that help others improve their skills in vulnerability analysis and exploitation.

## Current Challenges
Here are the challenges that I have created so far:
